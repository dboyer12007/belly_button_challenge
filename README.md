# belly_button_challenge
Link to the Git Pages is https://dboyer12007.github.io/belly_button_challenge/
I felt like this challenge was straight forward if you used the hints class examples.
I had some guidance writing the FOR LOOPs which I felt was the most challenging part.
I also seeked guidance on using git pages.
